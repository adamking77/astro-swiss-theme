<!-- Section: overview -->
## Project Overview

RetailMax Solutions approached us to completely redesign their existing e-commerce platform, which was suffering from poor user experience, slow loading times, and low conversion rates. The challenge was to create a modern, performant platform that could handle high traffic volumes while providing an intuitive shopping experience.

## The Challenge

The existing platform had several critical issues:
- **Performance**: Page load times averaging 5+ seconds
- **Mobile Experience**: Poor responsive design causing 60% mobile bounce rate
- **User Experience**: Confusing navigation and checkout process
- **Scalability**: System couldn't handle peak traffic periods
- **Conversion Rate**: Only 1.2% conversion rate across the platform

## Our Approach

### Research & Discovery
We conducted extensive user research, including:
- User interviews with 25 existing customers
- Competitor analysis of 10 leading e-commerce platforms
- Analytics review of user behavior patterns
- Technical audit of existing infrastructure

### Design Strategy
Our design approach focused on:
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Simplified navigation structure**
- **Streamlined checkout process**
- **Enhanced product discovery**
- **Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)**
