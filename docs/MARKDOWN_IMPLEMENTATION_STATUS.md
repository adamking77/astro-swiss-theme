# Markdown Content Collections - Implementation Status

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Updated Content Collection Configuration**: Changed the reports collection type from `data` to `content` to support Markdown files.

2. **Created Chart Wrapper Component**: Developed a `ChartWrapper.astro` component that can be used to embed charts in Markdown content.

3. **Updated Report Page Template**: Modified the report page template (`src/pages/reports/[slug].astro`) to handle both Markdown and JSON content:
   - Added support for rendering Markdown content using Astro's native `entry.render()` function
   - Implemented conditional rendering for Markdown vs JSON content
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing JSON reports

4. **Created Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation on how to use Markdown content collections.

## Known Issues

There appears to be an issue with the content collection validation that prevents Markdown files from being properly processed. The error message indicates that the `slug` field is required, even though it is present in the frontmatter.

## Next Steps

To fully implement Markdown support, you may need to:

1. **Check Astro Version**: Ensure you're using a compatible version of Astro that fully supports content collections with Markdown.

2. **Debug Validation**: Investigate the validation error by:
   - Checking the exact format of the frontmatter
   - Verifying that all required fields match the schema exactly
   - Testing with a minimal schema to isolate the issue

3. **Test with Simple Example**: Create a minimal Markdown file with only the required fields to test the basic functionality.

## Usage

Once the validation issue is resolved, you can create Markdown reports by:

1. Creating a new file in `src/content/reports/` with a `.md` extension
2. Adding frontmatter with the required metadata fields
3. Writing your content in Markdown format
4. Embedding charts using the `<ChartWrapper />` component

Example:
```md
---
id: "sample-report"
slug: "sample-report"
title: "Sample Report"
subtitle: "Sample Report Subtitle"
description: "Sample report description."
author: "Author Name"
publishDate: "June 2025"
category: "Strategic"
tags: ["Sample"]
readTime: "5 min read"

# Report Content

This is the main content of your report in Markdown format.

<ChartWrapper id="chart-id" title="Chart Title" description="Chart Description" />
```
